I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT TWO POSTS ON THE SAME DAY

So now I'm pretty worried about not writing the correct material in the blog posts. People in the class are on Facebook talking about it currently, and I found out that I might be the only one writing gibberish. I might also be the only person who is writing a single "blog" page instead of spacing every entry out on separate pages. But I'm kind of committed to it now (git it?) since class is all of five hours away, so I'm going to roll with these decisions and take the brutal repurcussions they might birth. 

It's dark in here. In my head, I mean. I imagine I'll have to go back and re-write all of these posts later on, in an honest attempt to look like I might actually have an idea of what I'm doing.
