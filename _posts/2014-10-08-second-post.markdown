My car windows were up. So that's good. 

I'm still not too clear on the length of a blog post, but I'm assuming the idea behind the homework was simply to demonstrate building an exceedingly simple webpage, and then using Git commands properly to upload the files. I could always e-mail the professors I suppose, but it's the weekend. I can always get clarification tomorrow in class. 

Am I supposed to be writing these blog posts on another page? Maybe I'll make one just as a backup. 

It's gray out today.

Why do I keep mispelling September? It's fixed now, but I did it twice in a row.
